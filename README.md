**[Click Here to Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/xhmmiRmxQ8Q)**.

* You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.

* If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.

* The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.

* If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
* If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.

* On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).


## HOW TO PLAY
* Click on the start button to get a question.
* Each question is timed. You will get 100 seconds to answer the question.
*Click on the answer choice you belive is correct. 
    *If this answer is correct, you will get an image with a message that says correct and you will get one point. 
    *If this answer is not correct, or you run out of time, you will get a message that says not correct, and then the correct image and answer will show up on the screen.
*After this happens, another question will load, and the timer will reset to 100 seconds.
*When the questions run out, your score will be displayed on the screen.

Good Luck!
